<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Brandon, GitHub username KeKoolKat. I currently have a very small amount of experience in HTML, CSS and PHP. The point of this GitHub account is to learn and broaden my experience as I am very passionate about technology.</p>
<!--Why can't I use CSS or html style elements?-->
